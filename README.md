This project has the aim to define a Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Dataset for review data classification. Furthermore, we make a fake review model using mainly python ML libraries.

## Summaries
1. <b>Introduction:</b> It is dedicated to an introduction on the problem instance and general description of the notebook contents
2. <b>Loading Dataset:</b> Description on how we loaded information on the pandas dataframe
3. <b>Data Analysis:</b> Analysis on the data types and values distribution in the entire dataset
4. <b>Data Pre-processing:</b> Manipulation of information to prepare data for model input
5. <b>Data modelling:</b> Building and training of models
6. <b>Data results:</b> Shows results on training phase and final metrics 
7. <b>Conclusions:</b> Final observations


## Dependencies
We produces a <i>requirement.txt</i> to use in the setting that should mantain dependencies consistency between different deployment. If you try to deploy it and have some dependencies problem; please, open an issue in the repository.


## Modelling description
Models are some samples about evaluation on some techniques in relation to the Yelp dataset. In other words, we can define a better model using some state-of-art architectures like BERT, XLNet or some of their variation. These models are in the version 2 which evaluates performance in relations to the old ones.
